# Roman Numeral Converter Project

- This project accepts arabic numbers (ints) as user input as the parameter for the project and returns the equivalent in roman numeral format
- My tests try to cover enough combinations of arabic numbers without there adding superfluous ones to achieve equivalence partitioning
- Covered tests for 0 input edge case, there is no 0 in roman numerals so method returns "NULLA" which is Latin for none
